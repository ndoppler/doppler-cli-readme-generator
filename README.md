# doppler-module-9-challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that generates a README.md file based on user input. We had functionality that accepted user text as well as user selections to generate copy, badges, and hyperlinks based on said input. We used Nodejs and JavaScript to generate the CLI app.

## Description
This App allows users to generate md documents that are filled out as a README.  We prompt the user to input text as well as make selections from a list to generate the readme content. 

## Usage
To run this project, please run the source code on a local machine in the command line after downloading the package from GitHub. To see current state of the project, please visit: [https://ndoppler.github.io/doppler-module-9-challenge/](https://ndoppler.github.io/doppler-module-9-challenge/).
